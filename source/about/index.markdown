I started off doing dial up tech support for a ISP. It was pretty hellish having to deal with the disaster that was the windows 95/96 tcp/ip stack and also dial up phone lines but I persevered and learned quite a lot about dealing with people.

I took me quit a few years and a couple more companies to work my way up in to being a UNIX system administrator once again at a fairly large ISP. I discovered the joy of working with FreeBSD and for a while it was quite alot of fun but then all of a sudden it become quite tedious. After setting up the basic lamp stack over and over again I felt like I needed to do something else.

At this time I was given the chance the amazing chance of becoming a software developer and I jumped at the opportunity. I worked a lot with Perl which was quite difficult for to grasp but then I was shown Ruby and it was like someone had turned a light on and I knew that this was the language that I wanted to code in.

So now I'm past the easy stuff like how do I make Ruby do what I want. Now I'm on to the much more difficult stuff like naming things and figuring out where things go. Thank goodness for people like [Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com/) and [Avdi Grim](http://about.avdi.org/)

I also regularly participate in meetups like [Code and Coffee](http://www.meetup.com/Code-Coffee-JHB) and [Ruby On Beer](http://www.meetup.com/RubyOnBeer/).
