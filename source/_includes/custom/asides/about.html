  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Rudi Kramer and I live in South Africa</p>
  <p>I started out as a dial-up tech support agent and then moved up to being a unix system admin. Currently I'm a (mostly) Ruby on Rails software developer with a bit of perl throw in because I must have  been a real bastard in my previous life.</p>
